# Real-Time-Collision-Risk-Estimation-via-Sensor-Fusion
I built an offline embedded system that fuses camera-based motion estimation with distance sensing to estimate collision risk in real time on resource-constrained hardware. The system uses classical computer vision and signal processing methods to achieve low-latency, interpretable performance without relying on networks or GPS.
